            <p>This proposal describes a structure for the Zcash Development Fund, to be enacted in Network Upgrade 6 and last for 4 years. This Dev Fund would consist of 15% of the block subsidies, as the following allocations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5% for the Zcash Foundation (for internal work and grants);</li>
                <li>4% for the Bootstrap Project (the parent of the Electric Coin Company) for the 1st year only;</li>
                <li>4% for Zcash Community Grants for continuation of their current activities as-is;</li>
                <li>2% for Qedit in support of their ZSA activities, and other Zcash protocol support;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Following the first year, when ECC will no longer receive their 4% allocation, those block subsidies will be distributed as 1% to ZCG, 1% to ZecHub, 1% to FPF, and 1% to ZF.</p>
            <p>Governance and accountability are based on existing entities and legal mechanisms, and increasingly decentralized governance is encouraged. This proposal mandates the ecosystem to design and deploy a "non-direct funding model" as generally recommended in Josh Swihart's proposal. <a id="footnote-reference-8" class="footnote_reference" href="#draft-swihart">13</a></p>
            <p>Upon creation/ activation of a "non-direct funding model" this ZIP should be reconsidered (potentially terminated) by the Zcash ecosystem, to determine if its ongoing direct block subsidies are preferred for continuation. Discussions/ solications/ sentiment gathering from the Zcash ecosystem should be initiated ~6 months in advance of the presumed activation of a "non-direct funding model", such that the Zcash ecosystem preference can be expediently realized.</p>
            <p>Block subsidies will be administered through two organizations:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Zcash Foundation (✳️ for ECC, ZCG)</li>
                <li>Financial Privacy Foundation (✳️ for Qedit, ZecHub)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>✳️ <strong>ZF and FPF adminstration of block subsidy details, costs, et al are currently under debate</strong> <a id="footnote-reference-9" class="footnote_reference" href="#zf-fpf-admin-details">14</a></p>

        <section id="motivation"><h2><span class="section-heading">Motivation</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#motivation"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>As of Zcash's second halving in November 2024, by default 100% of the block subsidies will be allocated to miners, and no further funds will be automatically allocated to any other entities. Consequently, no new funding may be available to existing teams dedicated to furthering charitable, educational, or scientific purposes, such as research, development, and outreach: the Electric Coin Company (ECC), the Zcash Foundation (ZF), the ZCG, and the many entities funded by the ZF and ZCG grant programs.</p>
            <p>There is a need to strike a balance between incentivizing the security of the consensus protocol (i.e., mining) versus crucial charitable, educational, and/or scientific aspects, such as research, development and outreach.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there is a need to balance the sustenance of ongoing work by the current teams dedicated to Zcash, with encouraging decentralization and growth of independent development teams.</p>
            <p>For these reasons, the Zcash Community desires to allocate and contribute a portion of the block subsidies otherwise allocated to miners as a donation to support charitable, educational, and scientific activities within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3).</p>
            <p>This proposal also introduces the benefit of a non-USA based entity (FPF) as the administrator for block subsidies to two organizations that are also non-USA based (Qedit and ZecHub). USA based regulatory risk continues to (negatively) impact the Zcash project, which has been predominantly based in the USA.</p>

            <p>The Dev Fund should encourage decentralization of the work and funding, by supporting new teams dedicated to Zcash.</p>
            <p>The Dev Fund should maintain the existing teams and capabilities in the Zcash ecosystem, unless and until concrete opportunities arise to create even greater value for the Zcash ecosystem.</p>
            <p>There should not be any single entity which is a single point of failure, i.e., whose capture or failure will effectively prevent effective use of the funds.</p>
            <p>Major funding decisions should be based, to the extent feasible, on inputs from domain experts and pertinent stakeholders.</p>
            <p>The Dev Fund mechanism should not modify the monetary emission curve (and in particular, should not irrevocably burn coins).</p>
            <p>In case the value of ZEC jumps, the Dev Fund recipients should not wastefully use excessive amounts of funds. Conversely, given market volatility and eventual halvings, it is desirable to create rainy-day reserves.</p>
            <p>The Dev Fund mechanism should not reduce users' financial privacy or security. In particular, it should not cause them to expose their coin holdings, nor cause them to maintain access to secret keys for much longer than they would otherwise. (This rules out some forms of voting, and of disbursing coins to past/future miners.)</p>
            <p>The Dev Fund system should be simple to understand and realistic to implement. In particular, it should not assume the creation of new mechanisms (e.g., election systems) or entities (for governance or development) for its execution; but it should strive to support and use these once they are built.</p>
            <p>Dev Fund recipients should comply with legal, regulatory, and taxation constraints in their pertinent jurisdiction(s).</p>

                <p>Starting at the second Zcash halving in 2024, until the third halving in 2028, 15% of the block subsidy of each block SHALL be allocated to a "Dev Fund" that consists of the following allocations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>5% for the Zcash Foundation (for internal work and grants);</li>

                    <li>4% for Zcash Community Grants for continuation of their current activities as-is;</li>
                    <li>2% for Qedit in support of their ZSA activities, and other Zcash protocol support;</li>

                    <p>This allocation of the Dev Fund is intended to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major and minor ongoing development (or other work) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem, to the extent that such teams are available and effective.</p>
                    <p>✳️ These funds SHALL be received and administered by ZF (or FPF, pending TBD outcomes of FPF proposal: <a id="footnote-reference-13" class="footnote_reference" href="#zf-fpf-admin-details">14</a>). ZF MUST disburse them for "Major Grants" and expenses reasonably related to the administration of Major Grants, but subject to the following additional constraints:</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>These funds MUST only be used to issue Major Grants to external parties that are independent of ZF, and to pay for expenses reasonably related to the administration of Major Grants. They MUST NOT be used by ZF for its internal operations and direct expenses not related to administration of Major Grants. Additionally, BP, ECC, and ZF are ineligible to receive Major Grants.</li>
                        <li>Major Grants SHOULD support well-specified work proposed by the grantee, at reasonable market-rate costs. They can be of any duration or ongoing without a duration limit. Grants of indefinite duration SHOULD have semiannual review points for continuation of funding.</li>
                        <li>Priority SHOULD be given to Major Grants that bolster teams with substantial (current or prospective) continual existence, and set them up for long-term success, subject to the usual grant award considerations (impact, ability, risks, team, cost-effectiveness, etc.). Priority SHOULD be given to Major Grants that support ecosystem growth, for example through mentorship, coaching, technical resources, creating entrepreneurial opportunities, etc. If one proposal substantially duplicates another's plans, priority SHOULD be given to the originator of the plans.</li>
                        <li>Major Grants SHOULD be restricted to furthering the Zcash cryptocurrency and its ecosystem (which is more specific than furthering financial privacy in general) as permitted under Section 501(c)(3).</li>
                        <li>Major Grants awards are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee. The Major Grant Review Committee SHALL be selected by the ZF's Community Advisory Panel or successor process.</li>
                        <li>The Major Grant Review Committee's funding decisions will be final, requiring no approval from the ZF Board, but are subject to veto if the Foundation judges them to violate U.S. law or the ZF's reporting requirements and other (current or future) obligations under U.S. IRS 501(c)(3).</li>
                        <li>Major Grant Review Committee members SHALL have a one-year term and MAY sit for reelection. The Major Grant Review Committee is subject to the same conflict of interest policy that governs the ZF Board of Directors (i.e. they MUST recuse themselves when voting on proposals where they have a financial interest). At most one person with association with the BP/ECC, and at most one person with association with the ZF, are allowed to sit on the Major Grant Review Committee. "Association" here means: having a financial interest, full-time employment, being an officer, being a director, or having an immediate family relationship with any of the above. The ZF SHALL continue to operate the Community Advisory Panel and SHOULD work toward making it more representative and independent (more on that below).</li>
                        <li>From 1st January 2022, a portion of the MG allocation shall be allocated to a Discretionary Budget, which may be disbursed for expenses reasonably related to the administration of Major Grants. The amount of funds allocated to the Discretionary Budget SHALL be decided by the ZF's Community Advisory Panel or successor process. Any disbursement of funds from the Discretionary Budget MUST be approved by the Major Grant Review Committee. Expenses related to the administration of Major Grants include, without limitation the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Paying third party vendors for services related to domain name registration, or the design, website hosting and administration of websites for the Major Grant Review Committee.</li>
                                <li>Paying independent consultants to develop requests for proposals that align with the Major Grants program.</li>
                                <li>Paying independent consultants for expert review of grant applications.</li>
                                <li>Paying for sales and marketing services to promote the Major Grants program.</li>
                                <li>Paying third party consultants to undertake activities that support the purpose of the Major Grants program.</li>
                                <li>Reimbursement to members of the Major Grant Review Committee for reasonable travel expenses, including transportation, hotel and meals allowance.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The Major Grant Review Committee's decisions relating to the allocation and disbursement of funds from the Discretionary Budget will be final, requiring no approval from the ZF Board, but are subject to veto if the Foundation judges them to violate U.S. law or the ZF's reporting requirements and other (current or future) obligations under U.S. IRS 501(c)(3).</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>ZF SHALL recognize the MG allocation of the Dev Fund as a Restricted Fund donation under the above constraints (suitably formalized), and keep separate accounting of its balance and usage under its <a href="#transparency-and-accountability">Transparency and Accountability</a> obligations defined below.</p>
                    <p>ZF SHALL strive to define target metrics and key performance indicators, and the Major Grant Review Committee SHOULD utilize these in its funding decisions.</p>

                    <p>These reports may be either organization-wide, or restricted to the income, expenses, and work associated with the receipt of Dev Fund. As BP is the parent organization of ECC it is expected they may publish joint reports.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that ECC, ZF, and ZCG will be focused primarily (in their attention and resources) on Zcash. Thus, they MUST promptly disclose:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any major activity they perform (even if not supported by the Dev Fund) that is not in the interest of the general Zcash ecosystem.</li>
                        <li>Any conflict of interest with the general success of the Zcash ecosystem.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>BP, ECC, ZF, and grant recipients MUST promptly disclose any security or privacy risks that may affect users of Zcash (by responsible disclosure under confidence to the pertinent developers, where applicable).</p>
                    <p>BP's reports, ECC's reports, and ZF's annual report on its non-grant operations, SHOULD be at least as detailed as grant proposals/reports submitted by other funded parties, and satisfy similar levels of public scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>All substantial software whose development was funded by the Dev Fund SHOULD be released under an Open Source license (as defined by the Open Source Initiative <a id="footnote-reference-14" class="footnote_reference" href="#osd">5</a>), preferably the MIT license.</p>

                    <p>For grant recipients, these conditions SHOULD be included in their contract with ZF, such that substantial violation, not promptly remedied, will cause forfeiture of their grant funds and their return to ZF.</p>
                    <p>BP, ECC, and ZF MUST contractually commit to each other to fulfill these conditions, and the prescribed use of funds, such that substantial violation, not promptly remedied, will permit the other party to issue a modified version of Zcash node software that removes the violating party's Dev Fund allocation, and use the Zcash trademark for this modified version. The allocation's funds will be reassigned to MG (whose integrity is legally protected by the Restricted Fund treatment).</p>

                <p>It is highly desirable to develop robust means of decentralized community voting and governance –either by expanding the Zcash Community Advisory Panel or a successor mechanism– and to integrate them into this process by the end of 2025. BP, ECC, ZCG, and ZF SHOULD place high priority on such development and its deployment, in their activities and grant selection.</p>

                <p>Members of ZF's Board of Directors MUST NOT hold equity in ECC or have current business or employment relationships with ECC, except as provided for by the grace period described below.</p>
                <p>Grace period: members of the ZF board who hold ECC equity (but do not have other current relationships to ECC) may dispose of their equity, or quit the Board, by 21 November 2024. (The grace period is to allow for orderly replacement, and also to allow time for ECC corporate reorganization related to Dev Fund receipt, which may affect how disposition of equity would be executed.)</p>
                <p>The Zcash Foundation SHOULD endeavor to use the Community Advisory Panel (or successor mechanism) as advisory input for future board elections.</p>
