Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST" and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119. [#RFC2119]_

The "Median Time Past" of a block in this document is to be interpreted as described in
[#zip-0113]_.


Abstract
========

This ZIP introduces relative lock-time (RLT) consensus-enforced semantics of the sequence
number field, to enable a signed transaction input to remain invalid for a defined period
of time after confirmation of its corresponding outpoint.


Motivation
==========

Zcash transactions have a sequence number field for each input, inherited from Bitcoin.
The original idea in Bitcoin appears to have been that a transaction in the mempool would
be replaced by using the same input with a higher sequence value. Although this was not
properly implemented, it assumes miners would prefer higher sequence numbers even if the
lower ones were more profitable to mine. However, a miner acting on profit motives alone
would break that assumption completely. The change described by this ZIP repurposes the
sequence number for new use cases without breaking existing functionality. It also leaves
room for future expansion and other use cases.

The transaction ``nLockTime`` is used to prevent the mining of a transaction until a
certain date. ``nSequence`` will be repurposed to prevent mining of a transaction until
a certain age of the spent output in blocks or timespan. This, among other uses, allows
bi-directional payment channels as used in [#deployable-lightning]_ and [#zip-0112]_.


Specification
=============

This specification defines the meaning of sequence numbers for transactions in blocks
after this proposal has activated.

If bit (1 << 31) of the sequence number is set, then no consensus meaning is applied to
the sequence number and can be included in any block under all currently possible
circumstances.

If bit (1 << 31) of the sequence number is not set, then the sequence number is
interpreted as an encoded relative lock-time.

The sequence number encoding MUST be interpreted as follows: 

Bit (1 << 22) determines if the relative lock-time is time-based or block based:
If the bit is set, the relative lock-time specifies a timespan in units of 32 seconds
granularity. The timespan starts from the Median Time Past of the outputâ€™s previous block,
and ends at the Median Time Past of the previous block. If the bit is not set, the
relative lock-time specifies a number of blocks.

Note: the 64-second time unit differs from Bitcoin's BIP 68, which uses a 512-second
time unit.

The flag (1 << 22) is the highest order bit in a 3-byte signed integer for use in
Zcash scripts as a 3-byte ``PUSHDATA`` with ``OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`` [#zip-0112]_.

This specification only interprets 22 bits of the sequence number as relative lock-time,
so a mask of ``0x003FFFFF`` MUST be applied to the sequence field to extract the relative
lock-time. The 22-bit specification allows for over 8.5 years of relative lock-time.

    A 32-bit field with 'Disable Flag' at bit (1 << 31), 'Type Flag' at bit (1 << 22), and 'Value' in the low 22 bits.

For time-based relative lock-time, 64-second granularity was chosen because the block
target spacing for Zcash, after activation of the Blossom network upgrade, is 75 seconds.
So when using block-based or time-based, roughly the same amount of time can be encoded
with the available number of bits. Converting from a sequence number to seconds is
performed by multiplying by 64.

When the relative lock-time is time-based, it is interpreted as a minimum block-time
constraint over the input's age. A relative time-based lock-time of zero indicates an
input which can be included in any block. More generally, a relative time-based
lock-time n can be included into any block produced 64 \* n seconds after the mining
date of the output it is spending, or any block thereafter.
The mining date of the output is equal to the Median Time Past of the previous block
that mined it.

The block produced time is equal to the Median Time Past of its previous block.

When the relative lock-time is block-based, it is interpreted as a minimum block-height
constraint over the input's age. A relative block-based lock-time of zero indicates an
input that can be included in any block. More generally, a relative block lock-time n
MAY be included n blocks after the mining date of the output it is spending, or any
block thereafter.

The new rules are not applied to the ``nSequence`` field of the input of the coinbase
transaction.

Acknowledgments
===============

This ZIP is based on BIP 68, authored by Mark Friedenbach, BtcDrak, Nicolas Dorier, and
kinoshitajona.

Credit goes to Gregory Maxwell for providing a succinct and clear description of the behavior
of this change, which became the basis of the BIP text.


Deployment
==========

At the time of writing it has not been decided which network upgrade (if any) will implement this
proposal.

This ZIP is designed to be deployed simultaneously with [#zip-0112]_ and [#zip-0113]_.


Compatibility
=============

The only use of sequence numbers by the zcashd reference client software is to disable checking
the ``nLockTime`` constraints in a transaction. The semantics of that application are preserved
by this ZIP.

As can be seen from the specification section, a number of bits are undefined by this ZIP to
allow for other use cases by setting bit (1 << 31) as the remaining 31 bits have no meaning
under this ZIP. Additionally, bits (1 << 23) through (1 << 30) inclusive have no meaning at all
when bit (1 << 31) is unset.

Unlike BIP 68 in Bitcoin, all of the low 22 bits are used for the value. This reflects the fact
that blocks are more frequent (75 seconds instead of 600 seconds), and so more bits are needed
to obtain approximately the same range of time.

The most efficient way to calculate sequence number from relative lock-time is with bit masks
and shifts:

.. hightlight::c++

       // 0 <= nHeight <= 4194303 blocks (~10 years at post-Blossom block target spacing)
       nSequence = nHeight;
       nHeight = nSequence & 0x003fffff;

       // 0 <= nTime <= 268435392 seconds (~8.5 years)
       nSequence = (1 << 22) | (nTime >> 6);
       nTime = (nSequence & 0x003fffff) << 6;
