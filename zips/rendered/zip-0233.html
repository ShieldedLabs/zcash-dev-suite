<h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “MAY”, “RECOMMENDED”,
“OPTIONAL”, and “REQUIRED” in this document are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119. [1]</p>
<p>The term “network upgrade” in this document is to be interpreted as
described in ZIP 200. [2]</p>
<p>“Block Subsidy” - the algorithmic issuance of ZEC on block creation –
part of the consensus rules. Split between the miner and the Dev Fund.
Also known as Block Reward.</p>
<p>“Issuance” - The method by which unmined or unissued ZEC is converted
to ZEC available to users of the network</p>
<p>“We” - the ZIP authors, owners listed in the above front matter</p>
<p>“<code>MAX_MONEY</code>” is the ZEC supply cap. For simplicity, this
ZIP defines it to be <code>21,000,000 ZEC</code>, although this is
slightly larger than the actual supply cap of the original ZEC issuance
mechanism.</p>
<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>This ZIP describes the motivation, the necessary changes for, and the
implementation specifications for the Zcash Sustainability Fund (ZSF).
The ZSF is a proposed alteration to the block rewards system and
accounting of unmined ZEC that allows for other sources of funding
besides unissued ZEC. This new mechanism for deposits – that new
applications or protocol designs can use to strengthen the long-term
sustainability of the network – will likely be an important step for
future economic upgrades, such as a transition to Proof of Stake or
Zcash Shielded Assets, and other potential protocol fees and user
applications.</p>
<p>The changes in this ZIP are ultimately minimal, only requiring for
the node to track state in the form of a <code>ZSF_BALANCE</code>, and
for a new transaction field to be added, called
<code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code>. While wallet developer would be encouraged to
add the <code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code> field to their UIs, no changes or new
behavior are absolutely required for developers or ZEC holders.</p>
<p>This ZIP does not change the current ZEC block subsidy issuance
schedule. Any additional amounts paid into the sustainability fund are
reserved for use in future ZIPs.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>The Zcash network’s operation and development relies fundamentally on
the block reward system inherited from Bitcoin. This system currently
looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>At Every New Block:
<ul>
<li>Miner and funding streams are rewarded a constant amount via
unissued ZEC (this constant amount halves at specified heights)</li>
<li>Miner is rewarded via Transaction fees
<code>(inputs - outputs)</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The Zcash Sustainability Fund is a proposed replacement to that
payout mechanism, with the relevant parts in <em>bold</em> below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unmined ZEC is now accounted for as
<code>ZSF_BALANCE</code></strong></li>
<li><strong>Transaction includes optional contributions to ZSF via a
<code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code> field</strong></li>
<li>Thus, at Every New Block:
<ul>
<li>Miner and funding streams rewarded the same constant amount,
<strong>but from <code>ZSF_BALANCE</code></strong> (this constant amount
still halves at specified heights)</li>
<li>Miner is rewarded via Transaction fees
<code>(inputs - outputs)</code>, <strong>where <code>outputs</code>
includes the <code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code> amount</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, an end-user wallet application could have an option to
contribute a portion of a transaction to the ZSF, which would be
included in a <code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code> field in the transaction, to be
taken into account by the Zcash nodes.</p>
<p>This quite simple alteration has – in our opinion – a multitude of
benefits:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Long Term Consensus Sustainability:</strong> This mechanism
supports long-term consensus sustainability by addressing concerns about
the sustainability of the network design shared by Bitcoin-like systems
through the establishment of deposits into the Sustainability Fund to
augment block rewards, ensuring long-term sustainability as the issuance
rate of Zcash drops and newly issued ZEC decreases over time.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits to ZEC Holders:</strong> Deposits to the ZSF slow
down the payout of ZEC, temporarily reducing its available supply,
benefiting current holders of unencumbered active ZEC in proportion to
their holdings without requiring them to opt into any scheme,
introducing extra risk, active oversight, or accounting complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery of “Soft-Burned” Funds:</strong> In some instances,
such as miners not claiming all available rewards, some ZEC goes
unaccounted for, though not formally burned. This proposal would recover
it through the <code>ZSF_BALANCE</code> mechanism described below.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>
<p>In practice, The Zcash Sustainability Fund is a single global balance
maintained by the node state and contributed to via a single transaction
field. This provides the economic and security support described in the
motivation section, while also importantly keeping the fund payouts
extremely simple to describe and implement.</p>
<p>The two modifications are: 1. The re-accounting of unmined ZEC as a
node state field called <code>ZSF_BALANCE</code> 2. The addition of a
transaction field called <code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code></p>
<h2 id="zsf_balance"><code>ZSF_BALANCE</code></h2>
<p>The ZEC issuance mechanism is re-defined to remove funds from
<code>ZSF_BALANCE</code>, which is initially set to
<code>MAX_MONEY</code> at the genesis block.</p>
<p>Consensus nodes are then required to track new per-block state:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ZSF_BALANCE[height] : u64 [zatoshi]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The state is a single 64 bit integer (representing units of
<code>zatoshi</code>) at any given block height, <span
class="math inline">height</span>, representing the Sustainability Fund
balance at that height. The <code>ZSF_BALANCE</code> can be calculated
using the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$\mathsf{ZsfBalanceAfter}(\mathsf{height})
= \mathsf{MAX\_MONEY} + \sum_{h = 0}^{\mathsf{height}}
(\mathsf{ZsfDeposit}(h) + \mathsf{Unclaimed}(h) -
\mathsf{BlockSubsidy}(h))$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">Unclaimed(height)</span> is the
portion of the block subsidy and miner fees that are unclaimed for the
block at the given height.</p>
<p>The block at height <span class="math inline">height</span> commits
to <span class="math inline">ZsfBalanceAfter(height)</span> as part of a
new block commitment in the block header, at the end of the
<code>hashBlockCommitments</code> chain in <a
href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0244#block-header-changes">ZIP-244</a>.</p>
<p>TODO ZIP editors: consider introducing a chain state commitment hash
tree. (When we get closer to the network upgrade, we will have a better
idea what commitments that network upgrade needs.)</p>
<h2 id="deposits-into-the-sustainability-fund">Deposits into the
Sustainability Fund</h2>
<p>Sustainability fund deposits can be made via the new
<code>zsfDeposit</code> field. This can be done by: - ZEC fund holders,
in non-coinbase transactions; - Zcash miners, in coinbase
transactions.</p>
<p>In transaction versions without this new field: - unclaimed miner
fees and rewards in <strong>coinbase transactions</strong> are
re-defined as deposits into the sustainability fund, and - there are no
sustainability fund deposits from non-coinbase transactions.</p>
<p>Note: older transaction versions can continue to be supported after a
network upgrade. For example, NU5 supports both v4 and v5 transaction
formats, for both coinbase and non-coinbase transactions.</p>
<h3 id="zsfdeposit-fields-in-transactions"><code>zsfDeposit</code>
fields in transactions</h3>
<p>Each transaction can dedicate some of its excess funds to the ZSF,
and the remainder becomes the miner fee, with any excess miner
fee/reward going to the ZSF</p>
<p>This is achieved by adding a new field to the common transaction
fields [#zip-0225-transaction-format]:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zsfDeposit : u64 [zatoshi]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ZSF_BALANCE[H]</code> for a block at height <code>H</code>
can be calculated given a value of <code>ZSF_BALANCE[H-1]</code> and the
set of transactions contained in that block. First, the
<code>ZSF_DEPOSIT[H]</code> is calculated based solely on
<code>ZSF_BALANCE[H-1]</code>. This is subtracted from the previous
block’s balance to be distributed as part of the block reward. Second,
the sum of all the <code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code> fields of all transactions
in the block is added to the balance.</p>
<h3 id="non-coinbase-transactions">Non-Coinbase Transactions</h3>
<p>If the <code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code> field is not present in an older
transaction version, it is defined to be zero for non-coinbase
transactions.</p>
<h4 id="consensus-rule-changes">Consensus Rule Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Transparent inputs to a transaction insert value into a transparent
transaction value pool associated with the transaction. Transparent
outputs <strong>and sustainability fund deposits</strong> remove value
from this pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coinbase-transactions">Coinbase Transactions</h3>
<p>Any excess miner fee/reward is sent to the ZSF.</p>
<p>In new blocks, this deposit is tracked via the
<code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code> field in coinbase transactions.</p>
<p>If the <code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code> field is not present in a coinbase
transaction with an older transaction version, it is defined as the
value of any unspent miner fee and miner reward. This re-defines these
previously unspendable funds as ZSF deposits.</p>
<h4 id="consensus-rule-changes-1">Consensus Rule Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The remaining value in the transparent transaction value pool of a
coinbase transaction is <strong>deposited in the sustainability
fund</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zsf_deposit-requirements"><code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code>
Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>ZIP 230 [3] must be updated to include
<code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code>.</li>
<li>ZIP 244 [4] must be updated as well to include
<code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
<p>All technical decisions in this ZIP are balanced between the
necessary robustness of the ZSF mechanics, and simplicity of
implementation.</p>
<h2 id="zsf_balance-as-node-state"><code>ZSF_BALANCE</code> as node
state</h2>
<p>Tracking the <code>ZSF_BALANCE</code> value as a node state using the
above formula is very simple in terms of implementation, and should work
correctly given that the node implementations calculate the value
according to the specifications.</p>
<h2
id="zsf_deposit-as-explicit-transaction-field"><code>ZSF_DEPOSIT</code>
as explicit transaction field</h2>
<p>An explicit value distinguishes the ZEC destined to Sustainability
Fund deposits from the implicit transaction fee. Explicitness also
ensures any arithmetic flaws in any implementations are more likely to
be observed and caught immediately.</p>
<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>
<p>This ZIP is proposed to activate with Network Upgrade (TODO ZIP
editors).</p>
