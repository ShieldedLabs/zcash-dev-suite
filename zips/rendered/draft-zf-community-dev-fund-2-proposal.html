            <p>This proposal describes a structure for a new Zcash Development Fund (“Dev Fund”), to be enacted in Network Upgrade 6 and last for 2 years. This Dev Fund shall consist of 20% of the block subsidies.</p>
            <p>The Dev Fund shall be split into 3 slices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>32% for Zcash Foundation;</li>
                <li>40% for "Zcash Community Grants", intended to fund large-scale long-term Projects (administered by the Financial Privacy Foundation, with extra community input and scrutiny).</li>
                <li>28% for a Dev Fund Reserve, to be stored in a Lockbox.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Lockbox will securely store funds until a disbursement mechanism is established in a future ZIP.</p>
            <p>Governance and accountability are based on existing entities and legal mechanisms, and increasingly decentralized governance is encouraged.</p>

            <p>Starting at Zcash's second halving in November 2024, the first Dev Fund will expire, meaning that by default 100% of the block subsidies will be allocated to miners, and no further funds will be automatically allocated to any other entities. Consequently, no substantial new funding may be available to existing teams dedicated to furthering charitable, educational, or scientific purposes, such as research, development, and outreach: the Electric Coin Company (ECC), the Zcash Foundation (ZF), and the many entities funded by the ZF grants and Zcash Community Grants programs.</p>
            <p>There is a need to continue to strike a balance between incentivizing the security of the consensus protocol (i.e., mining) versus crucial charitable, educational, and/or scientific aspects, such as research, development and outreach.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there is a need to balance the sustenance of ongoing work by the current teams dedicated to Zcash, with encouraging decentralization and growth of independent development teams.</p>
            <p>For these reasons, the Zcash Community desires to allocate and contribute a slice of the block subsidies otherwise allocated to miners as a donation to support charitable, educational, and scientific activities within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of the United States Code, and the Cayman Islands’ Foundation Companies Law, 2017.</p>
            <p>The Zcash Community also supports the concept of a non-direct funding model, and desires to allocate a slice of the block subsidies otherwise allocated to miners to a Lockbox, with the expectation that those funds will be distributed under a non-direct funding model, which may be implemented in a future network upgrade.</p>
            <p>For these reasons, the Zcash Community wishes to establish a Hybrid Development Fund after the second halving in November 2024, and apportion it among ZF, ZCG, and a Dev Fund Reserve to be held in a Lockbox.</p>

        <section id="requirements"><h2><span class="section-heading">Requirements</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#requirements"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>The Dev Fund should encourage decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem, by supporting new teams dedicated to Zcash.</p>
            <p>The Dev Fund should maintain the existing teams and capabilities in the Zcash ecosystem, unless and until concrete opportunities arise to create even greater value for the Zcash ecosystem.</p>
            <p>There should not be any single entity which is a single point of failure, i.e., whose capture or failure will effectively prevent effective use of the funds.</p>
            <p>Major funding decisions should be based, to the extent feasible, on inputs from domain experts and pertinent stakeholders.</p>
            <p>The Dev Fund mechanism itself should not modify the monetary emission curve (and in particular, should not irrevocably burn coins).</p>
            <p>In case the value of ZEC jumps, the Dev Fund recipients should not wastefully use excessive amounts of funds. Conversely, given market volatility and eventual halvings, it is desirable to create rainy-day reserves.</p>
            <p>The Dev Fund mechanism should not reduce users' financial privacy or security. In particular, it should not cause them to expose their coin holdings, nor cause them to maintain access to secret keys for much longer than they would otherwise. (This rules out some forms of voting, and of disbursing coins to past/future miners.)</p>
            <p>The new Dev Fund system should be simple to understand and realistic to implement. In particular, it should not assume the creation of new mechanisms (e.g., election systems) or entities (for governance or development) for its execution; but it should strive to support and use these once they are built.</p>
            <p>The Dev Fund should comply with legal, regulatory, and taxation constraints in pertinent jurisdictions.</p>
            <p>The Lockbox must be prepared to allocate resources efficiently once the disbursement mechanism is defined. This includes ensuring that funds are readily available for future projects and not tied up in organizational overhead.</p>
            <p>The Lockbox must implement robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access or misuse of funds. It must not be possible to disburse funds from the Lockbox until the Zcash Community reaches consensus on the design of a disbursement mechanism that is defined in a ZIP and implemented as part of a future Network Upgrade.</p>

            <p>General on-chain governance is outside the scope of this proposal.</p>
            <p>Rigorous voting mechanisms (whether coin-weighted, holding-time-weighted or one-person-one-vote) are outside the scope of this proposal, though there is prescribed room for integrating them once available.</p>

                <p>Starting at the second Zcash halving in 2024, until block height 3566400 (which is expected to occur approximately two years after the second Zcash halving), 20% of the block subsidy of each block SHALL be allocated to a Dev Fund that consists of the following three slices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>32% for the Zcash Foundation (denoted <strong>ZF slice</strong>);</li>
                    <li>40% for the Financial Privacy Foundation, for "Zcash Community Grants" for large-scale long-term projects (denoted <strong>ZCG slice</strong>);</li>
                    <li>28% for the Dev Fund Reserve (denoted <strong>DFR slice</strong>).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The slices are described in more detail below. The fund flow will be implemented at the consensus-rule layer, by sending the corresponding ZEC to the designated address(es) for each block. This Dev Fund will end at block height 3566400 (unless extended/modified by a future ZIP).</p>

                    <p>This slice of the Dev Fund will flow as charitable contributions from the Zcash Community to ZF, to be used at its discretion for any purpose within its mandate to support financial privacy and the Zcash platform, including: development, education, supporting community communication online and via events, gathering community sentiment, and awarding external grants for all of the above, subject to the requirements of Section 501(c)(3). The ZF slice will be treated as a charitable contribution from the Community to support these educational, charitable, and scientific purposes.</p>

                    <p>This slice of the Dev Fund is intended to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development (or other work) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem, to the extent that such teams are available and effective.</p>
                    <p>The funds SHALL be received and administered by FPF. FPF MUST disburse them for "Zcash Community Grants" and expenses reasonably related to the administration of Zcash Community Grants, but subject to the following additional constraints:</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>These funds MUST only be used to issue Zcash Community Grants to external parties that are independent of FPF or to Autonomous Entities that operate under the FPF umbrella, and to pay for expenses reasonably related to the administration of Zcash Community Grants. They MUST NOT be used by FPF for its internal operations and direct expenses not related to administration of Zcash Community Grants. Additionally, ZF is ineligible to receive Zcash Community Grants while ZF is receiving a slice of the Dev Fund.</li>
                        <li>Zcash Community Grants SHOULD support well-specified work proposed by the grantee, at reasonable market-rate costs. They can be of any duration or ongoing without a duration limit. Grants of indefinite duration SHOULD be reviewed periodically (on a schedule that the Zcash Community Grants Committee considers appropriate for the value and complexity of the grant) for continuation of funding.</li>
                        <li>Priority SHOULD be given to Zcash Community Grants that bolster teams with substantial (current or prospective) continual existence, and set them up for long-term success, subject to the usual grant award considerations (impact, ability, risks, team, cost-effectiveness, etc.). Priority SHOULD Be given to grants that support ecosystem growth, for example through mentorship, coaching, technical resources, creating entrepreneurial opportunities, etc. If one proposal substantially duplicates another's plans, priority SHOULD be given to the originator of the plans.</li>
                        <li>Zcash Community Grants SHOULD be restricted to furthering the Zcash cryptocurrency and its ecosystem (which is more specific than furthering financial privacy in general).</li>
                        <li>Zcash Community Grants awards are subject to approval by a five-seat Zcash Community Grants Committee. The Zcash Community Grants Committee SHALL be selected by the ZF's Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) or successor process.</li>
                        <li>The Zcash Community Grants Committee's funding decisions will be final, requiring no approval from the FPF Board, but are subject to veto if FPF judges them to violate Cayman law or the FPF's reporting requirements and other (current or future) obligations under the Cayman Islands’ Companies Act (2023 Revision) and Foundation Companies Law, 2017.</li>
                        <li>Zcash Community Grants Committee members SHALL have a one-year term and MAY sit for reelection. The Zcash Community Grants Committee is subject to the same conflict of interest policy that governs the FPF Board of Directors (i.e. they MUST recuse themselves when voting on proposals where they have a financial interest). At most one person with association with the BP/ECC, at most one person with association with the ZF and at most one person with association with the FPF, are allowed to sit on the Zcash Community Grants Committee. "Association" here means: having a financial interest, full-time employment, being an officer, being a director, or having an immediate family relationship with any of the above.</li>
                        <li>A portion of the ZCG Slice shall be allocated to a Discretionary Budget, which may be disbursed for expenses reasonably related to the administration of Zcash Community Grants. The amount of funds allocated to the Discretionary Budget SHALL be decided by the ZF's Zcash Community Advisory Panel or successor process. Any disbursement of funds from the Discretionary Budget MUST be approved by the Zcash Community Grants Committee. Expenses related to the administration of Zcash Community Grants include, without limitation the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Paying for operational management and administration services that support the purpose of the Zcash Community Grants program, including administration services provided by FPF.</li>
                                <li>Paying third party vendors for services related to domain name registration, or the design, website hosting and administration of websites for the Zcash Community Grants Committee.</li>
                                <li>Paying independent consultants to develop requests for proposals that align with the Zcash Community Grants program.</li>
                                <li>Paying independent consultants for expert review of grant applications.</li>
                                <li>Paying for sales and marketing services to promote the Zcash Community Grants program.</li>
                                <li>Paying third party consultants to undertake activities that support the purpose of the Zcash Community Grants program.</li>
                                <li>Reimbursement to members of the Zcash Community Grants Committee for reasonable travel expenses, including transportation, hotel and meals allowance.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The Zcash Community Grants Committee's decisions relating to the allocation and disbursement of funds from the Discretionary Budget will be final, requiring no approval from the FPF Board, but are subject to veto if FPF judges them to violate Cayman law or the FPF's reporting requirements and other (current or future) obligations under Cayman Islands law.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>A portion of the Discretionary Budget MAY be allocated to provide reasonable compensation to members of the Zcash Community Grants Committee. The time for which each Committee member is compensated SHALL be limited to the hours needed to successfully perform their positions, up to a maximum of 15 hours in each month, and MUST align with the scope and responsibilities of that member's role. The compensation rate for each Committee member SHALL be $115 per hour (and therefore the maximum compensation for a Committee member is $1725 per month). The allocation and distribution of compensation to committee members SHALL be administered by FPF. Changes to the hours or rate SHALL be determined by the ZF’s Zcash Community Advisory Panel or successor process.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>As part of the contractual commitment specified under the <a href="#enforcement">Enforcement</a> section below, FPF SHALL be contractually required to recognize the ZCG slice of the Dev Fund as a Restricted Fund donation under the above constraints (suitably formalized), and keep separate accounting of its balance and usage under its <a href="#transparency-and-accountability">Transparency and Accountability</a> obligations defined below.</p>

                    <p>ZF, FPF and Zcash Community Grant recipients (during and leading to their award period) SHALL all accept the obligations in this section.</p>
                    <p>Ongoing public reporting requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quarterly reports, detailing future plans, execution on previous plans, and finances (balances, and spending broken down by major categories).</li>

                    <p>These reports may be either organization-wide, or restricted to the income, expenses, and work associated with the receipt of Dev Fund.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that ZF, FPF and Zcash Community Grant recipients will be focused primarily (in their attention and resources) on Zcash. Thus, they MUST promptly disclose:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any major activity they perform (even if not supported by the Dev Fund) that is not in the interest of the general Zcash ecosystem.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>BP, ECC, ZF, FPF and grant recipients MUST promptly disclose any security or privacy risks that may affect users of Zcash (by responsible disclosure under confidence to the pertinent developers, where applicable).</p>
                    <p>ZF's and FPF's annual reports on its non-grant operations, SHOULD be at least as detailed as grant proposals/reports submitted by other funded parties, and satisfy similar levels of public scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>All substantial software whose development was funded by the Dev Fund SHOULD be released under an Open Source license (as defined by the Open Source Initiative <a id="footnote-reference-9" class="footnote_reference" href="#osd">5</a>), preferably the MIT license.</p>
                    <p>The ZF SHALL continue to operate the Zcash Community Advisory Panel and SHOULD work toward making it more representative and independent (more on that below).</p>

                    <p>ZF and FPF MUST contractually commit to each other to fulfill these conditions, and the prescribed use of funds, such that substantial violation, not promptly remedied, will permit the other parties to issue a modified version of Zcash node software that removes the violating party's Dev Fund slice, and use the Zcash trademark for this modified version. The slice's funds will be reassigned to ZCG (whose integrity is legally protected by the Restricted Fund treatment).</p>

                <p>Nothing in this ZIP is intended to preclude any amendments to the Dev Fund (including but not limited to, changes to the Dev Fund allocation and/or the addition of new Dev Fund recipients), if such amendments enjoy the consensus support of the Zcash community.</p>

                <p>ZF and FPF SHOULD facilitate the amendment or replacement of the Dev Fund if there is sufficient community support for doing so.</p>
                <p>This ZIP recognizes there is strong community support for a non-direct funding model. As such, ZF MUST collaborate with the Zcash community to research and explore the establishment of a non-direct funding model.

                <p>Decentralized community governance is used in this proposal via the Zcash Community Advisory Panel as input into the Zcash Community Grants Committee which governs the <a href="#zcg-slice-zcash-community-grants">ZCG slice (Zcash Community Grants)</a>.</p>
                <p>It is highly desirable to develop robust means of decentralized community voting and governance, either by expanding the Zcash Community Advisory Panel or a successor mechanism. ZF, FPF and ZCG SHOULD place high priority on such development and its deployment, in their activities and grant selection.</p>

            <p>This proposal is a modification of ZIP 1014 <a id="footnote-reference-10" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-1014">11</a> by the Zcash Foundation based on feedback and suggestions from the community, and incorporating elements of draft ZIPs by community members Jason McGee and Skylar.</p>
            <p>ZIP 1014 is a limited modification of Eran Tromer's ZIP 1012 <a id="footnote-reference-11" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-1012">10</a> by the Zcash Foundation and ECC, further modified by feedback from the community.</p>
            <p>Eran's proposal is most closely based on the Matt Luongo 'Decentralize the Dev Fee' proposal (ZIP 1011) <a id="footnote-reference-12" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-1011">9</a>. Relative to ZIP 1011 there are substantial changes and mixing in of elements from <em>@aristarchus</em>'s '20% Split Evenly Between the ECC and the Zcash Foundation' (ZIP 1003) <a id="footnote-reference-13" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-1003">7</a>, Josh Cincinnati's 'Compromise Dev Fund Proposal With Diverse Funding Streams' (ZIP 1010) <a id="footnote-reference-14" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-1010">8</a>, and extensive discussions in the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/">Zcash Community Forum</a>, including valuable comments from forum users <em>@aristarchus</em> and <em>@dontbeevil</em>.</p>
