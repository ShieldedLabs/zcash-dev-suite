# Terminology

The key words “MUST”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “MAY”, “RECOMMENDED”, “OPTIONAL”,
and “REQUIRED” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [1]

"Network upgrade" - to be interpreted as described in ZIP 200. [2]

“Block Subsidy” - to be interpreted as described in the Zcash Protocol
Specification (TODO ZIP Editors: link from comment).

“Issuance” - the sum of Block Subsidies over time. (TODO ZIP Editors: work out
if this definition is correct or can be removed).

“`ZsfBalanceAfter(h)`” is the total ZEC available in the Zcash Sustainability
Fund (ZSF) after the transactions in block `h`, described in ZIP draft-zsf.md.
In this ZIP, the Sustainability Fund is used to pay out Block Subsidies from
unmined ZEC, and other fund deposits.

Let `PostBlossomHalvingInterval` be as defined in [#protocol-diffadjustment]_.


# Abstract

This ZIP proposes a change to how nodes calculate the block subsidy.

Instead of following a step function around the 4-year halving intervals
inherited from Bitcoin, we propose a slow exponential “smoothing” of the curve.
The new issuance scheme would approximate the current issuance over 4-year
intervals.

This ZIP depends on the ZIP introducing the Zcash Sustainability Fund
(ZIP-XXX).

# Motivation

The current Zcash economic model, inherited from Bitcoin, includes a halving
mechanism which dictates the issuance of new coins. While this has been
foundational, halvings can lead to abrupt changes in the rate of new coins
being introduced to the market. Such sudden shifts can potentially disrupt the
network's economic model, potentially impacting its security and stability.
Furthermore, the halvings schedule is fixed and does not provide any way to
"recycle" funds into future issuance.

To address this, we propose issuing a fixed portion of the pending
funds-to-be-issued in each block. This has the effect of smoothing out the
issuance curve of ZEC, ensuring a more consistent and predictable rate of coin
issuance, while still preserving the overall supply cap of 21,000,000 coins.
This mechanism by itself (without other anticipated changes) seeks to preserve
the core aspects of Zcash's issuance policy and aims to enhance predictability
and avoid sudden changes. By making this shift, the average block subsidy over
time will remain predictable with very gradual changes.

However, we anticipate schemes proposed in [#draft-zsf]_ where the amount of
funds-to-be-issued may increase. In that scenario, this issuance mechanism
would distribute that increase starting in the immediately following block and
subsequent blocks. Because this distribution mechanism has an exponential
decay, such increases will be spread out in miniscule amounts to future blocks
over a long time period. This issuance mechanism thus provides a way for
potential increases or decreases of issuance while constraining those changes
to be small on a short time scale to avoid unexpected disruptions. 

Additionally, the current Bitcoin-style issuance does not take into account the
current balance of `ZsfBalanceAfter(h)`. If [#draft-zsf]_ were to activate
without a change to the issuance mechanism, then some funds would never be
disbursed after they are deposited back into the ZSF.

# Requirements

Smoothing the issuance curve is possible using an exponential decay formula
that satisfies the following requirements:

## Issuance Requirements

1. The issuance can be summarised into a reasonably simple explanation
2. Block subsidies approximate a continuous function
3. If there are funds in the ZSF, then the block subsidy must be non-zero,
   preventing any final “unmined” zatoshis
4. For any 4 year period, all paid out block subsidies are approximately equal
   to half of the ZSF at the beginning of that 4 year period, if there are no
   deposits into the ZSF during those 4 years

TODO daira: add a requirement that makes the initial total issuance match the previous total issuance  

# Specification

## Goals

We want to decrease the short-term impact of the deployment of this ZIP on
block reward recipients, and minimise the potential reputational risk to Zcash
of changing the block reward amount.

## Constants

Define constants:

“`BLOCK_SUBSIDY_FRACTION`” = 4126 / 10,000,000,000 or `0.0000004126`

"`DEPLOYMENT_BLOCK_HEIGHT`" = 2726400

## Issuance Calculation

At the `DEPLOYMENT_BLOCK_HEIGHT`, nodes should switch from the current issuance
calculation, to the following:

Given the block height `h` define a function **BlockSubsidy(h)**, such that:

**BlockSubsidy(h)** = Block subsidy for a given `h`, that satisfies above
requirements.

Using an exponential decay function for **BlockSubsidy** satisfies requirements
**R1** and **R2** above:

`BlockSubsidy(h) = BLOCK_SUBSIDY_FRACTION * ZsfBalanceAfter(h - 1)`

Finally, to satisfy **R3** above we always round up to the next zatoshi.

`BlockSubsidy(h) = ceiling(BLOCK_SUBSIDY_FRACTION * ZsfBalanceAfter(h - 1))`

# Rationale

## `BLOCK_SUBSIDY_FRACTION`

Let `IntendedZSFFractionRemainingAfterFourYears` = 0.5.

The value `4126 / 10_000_000_000` satisfies the approximation within +0.002%:

`(1 - BLOCK_SUBSIDY_FRACTION)^PostBlossomHalvingInterval ≈ IntendedZSFFractionRemainingAfterFourYears`

Meaning after a period of 4 years around half of `ZSF_BALANCE` will be paid out
as block subsidies, thus satisfying **R4**.

The largest possible amount in the ZSF is MAX_MONEY, in the theoretically
possible case that all issued funds are deposited back into the ZSF. If this
happened, the largest interim sum in the block subsidy calculation would be
MAX_MONEY * 4126 + 10000000000.

This uses 62.91 bits, which is just under the 63 bit limit for 64-bit signed
two's-complement integer amount types.

The numerator could be brought closer to the limit by using a larger
denominator, but the difference in the amount issued would be very small. So we
chose a power-of-10 denominator for simplicity.

TODO for ZIP owners: How many ZEC per day?

## `DEPLOYMENT_BLOCK_HEIGHT`

The deployment should happen at the next halving, which is block `2726400`.

Since there is a planned halving at this point, there will already be a
significant "shock" caused by the drop in issuance caused by the halving. This
reduces surprise and thus increases security. Also, due to the nature of the
smoothed curve having a portion of the curve above the respective step function
line at times, this will maximally _reduce_ the issuance shock at the
`DEPLOYMENT_BLOCK_HEIGHT`.

## Visualization of the Smoothed Curve

The following graph illustrates compares issuance for the current halving-based
step function vs the smoothed curve.

# Deployment

The implementation of this ZIP MUST be deployed at the same time or after the
Zcash Sustainability Fund is established (ZIP-XXX).

# Appendix: Simulation

The [ZSF simulator](https://github.com/eigerco/zsf-simulator) allows us to
simulate the effects of this ZIP on the ZSF balance and the block subsidy, as
well as generate plots like the ones above. Its output:

```
Last block is 47917869 in ~113.88 years
```

indicates that, assuming no ZEC is ever deposited to the ZSF, its balance will
be depleted after 113.88 years, and the block subsidy will be 0 ZEC after that
point.

This fragment of the output 

```
Halving  1 at block  1680000:
  ZSF subsidies:    262523884819889 (~ 2625238.848 ZEC,        1.563 ZEC per block)
  legacy subsidies: 262500000000000 (~ 2625000.000 ZEC,        1.562 ZEC per block)
  difference:           23884819889 (~         238 ZEC),         ZSF/legacy: 1.0001
```

shows that the difference between the smoothed out and the current issuance
schemes is 238 ZEC after 1680000 blocks (aroound 4 years).
